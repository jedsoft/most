Changes since 5.0.0
1. src/Makefile.in: Install docs in $prefix/share/doc

Changes since 4.10.2
0. src/most.c: version bumped to 5.0.0-x
1. src/line.c: Added support for embedded ANSI escape sequences that
   seem to be more common in man pages.
2. When switching searching directions, and no search string was
   entered at the search prompt, use the previous string.
3. Added patches for UTF-8 support kindly provided by Javier Kohen.
4. src/most.c: Removed references to Kanji from the usage message.
   Kanji is not supported by slang-2.  Use Unicode.
5. src/file.c: Most will automatically start up in binary mode if the
   file contains a nul-byte in the first 512 characters.  Previously,
   it would switch into binary mode when the file contained any
   characters with the most significant bit set.
6. autoconf/config.sub,config.guess: Updated to more recent versions.
7. src/most.c: Add +u/-u switches to force UTF-8 on/off.  The default
   behavior depends upon the locale.
8. src/sysdep.c: In most_getkey, if SLang_getkey returns an error,
   then just exit.
9. src/search.c: Added `#undef SLANG_REGEXP' and `#undef
   HAVE_V8_REGCOMP' until the regexp searches are rewritten.
10. src/edit.c: Filenames are quoted before being passed to the shell
    for editing.
11. src/file.c: Filenames are quoted before being passed to the unzip
    program.
12. src/sysdep.c: Check the process group id of the terminal and
    if it does not match that of most, then exit.
13. src/keym.c: Added "find_next_other_dir" function and bound it to N.
14. src/most.c: New commandline switch: "-d".  This switch disables
    the display of the \ character used to denote a wrapped line.
15. src/line.c: Added support for embedded ansi-color escape
    sequences, e.g., `ls --color | most`
16. src/window.c: Added an error hook to prevent slang from writing to
    stderr.
17. src/line.c: An ascii character+combining character was not being
    handled.

Changes since 4.10.1
1. src/window.c:most_read_from_minibuffer: An variable was not being
   initialized. (Kevin Oberman, oberman at es, net).
2. configure: mmap is enabled by default.  Use the --disable-mmap
   configure option of you do not want it.

Changes since 4.10.0
1. src/most.h: Prototype for SLang_set_error inconsistent with the
   function in most.c.
2. src/most.h: If compiled against slang2 without an snprintf
   function, use _pSLsnprintf.

Changes since 4.9.5
0. src/*.c: Various changes to support slang 2.  Version bumped to
   4.10.0.  UTF-8 support not yet available.
1. src/keym.c: Ignore mouse events under DOS/Windows (Gisle Vanem,
   giva at bgnett, no).

Changes since 4.9.4
1. src/line.c: A "length" variable was declared as unsigned char
   instead of unsigned int, causing a SEGV for columns larger than 255.
2. src/file.c: fixed a buffer overflow caused by a long file name on
   the command line.

Changes since 4.9.3

1. src/buffer.c: SLtt_Screen_Rows and SLtt_Screen_Cols were swapped
   causing a file to be improperly displayed in wrap mode.  Adrian P.
   van Bloois (adrian at accu.uu.nlhas) has my thanks for find this bug.
2. src/most.c: when run without arguments, S-Lang library version also
   printed.

Changes since 4.9.2

1. src/keym.c: added support for \xE0 type arrow keys (Win9X).
2. src/file.c: When resyncing mmaped buffer, make sure to preserve the
   current line number.
3. src/sysdep.c: SLang_getkey_intr_hook is unix
   specific and should not be used on VMS.
4. src/file.c: Make arrow-keys for next_file_cmd work on win32 systems.
5. src/file.h: be sure to quote filename argument (Mako Hill
   <mako@debian.org>)
6. src/file.c: added support for bzip2 files
7. src/*.c: replace calls to sprintf with _SLsnprintf (Steve Kemp
   <skx@tardis.ed.ac.uk>).

Changes since 4.9.1
0. Added support for using mmap to read files.  Use configure
   --enable-mmap to enable this experimental feature.
1. Wrapping bug fixed.  Also some optimizations were made to speed up
   the display of wrapped files.
2. File default.rc renamed to most.rc.
3. A^H_ interpreted as underline.  Previously, _^HA was recognized.
4. Jerome Lauret <JLAURET@mail.chem.sunysb.edu> provided most.hlp, as
   well as a few VMS patches.
5. src/Makefile.in: patch to make most's Makefile respect DESTDIR as
   well as removing the hardcoded use of $(prefix)/etc for the
   location of most's config file. <brad@comstyle.com>
6. src/line.c: some simplifications and cleanups designed to avoid
   nasty problems with extremely long lines.

Changes since 4.9.0
1. MOST_SWITCHES env variable can now contain extended switches.
2. If most is reading from stdin, it will reinit the terminal when it
   encounters an EOF on stdin.  This is to work around a problem under
   linux where for some reason, some other process resets the terminal.
Changes since 4.8.1
1. Apparantly, the binary flag +b is not valid with POSIX popen.
2. Screen resize code modified so that most works in a SunOS cmdtool.
3. Color support added.  Use `most -C' to disable.
4. Ported to Mingw32 (GNU C)

Changes since 4.7
1. Added tail -f type mode.  Use F to activate.
2. OS/2 port provided by j.burnell@irl.cri.nz (John Burnell).
3. Left/Right arrow scroll 1 column.  Use <, > to scroll in larger
   chunks.

Changes since 4.6
0. Various cleanups and other improvements
1. Binary mode displays byte offset
2. Ported to DJGPP

Changes since 4.5
1. Many changes to enable MOST use the S-Lang screen management routines.

Features in 4.5
1. More cleanup/bug fixes
2. Regular expression searches 
3. Automatic detection of compressed files.

Features in 4.41:
1. Modified to read raw directry file in BINARY mode.

New features in MOST 4.4:

1. User definable keymaps
2. ISO Latin1 8 bit clean
3. Edit and recall previous search strings
4. Much friendlier, lots of messages and help
5. VMS ``Gopher ready''
6. Cleaned up alot and small bugs fixed
7. Most now re-reads the file after editing.

New Features since MOST version 3.x (Sept 25, 1994)

1.  Terminfo/termcap under Unix supported
2.  -1 flag specifies terminal is a VT100 and not anything better, e.g.,
     VT102. (VMS only)
3.  MOST will only read in what it has to.  This means it starts up alot
    faster on large files.
4.  Cleaned up alot.

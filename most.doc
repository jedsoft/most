       _m_o_s_t is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a
       time,  the  contents  of  a file on a terminal.  It pauses
       after each windowful and prints on the window status  line
       the  screen  the  file  name, current line number, and the
       percentage of the file so far displayed.

       Unlike other paging programs, _m_o_s_t is capable of  display-
       ing  an arbitrary number of windows as long as each window
       occupies at least two screen lines.  Each window may  con-
       tain the same file or a different file.  In addition, each
       window has its own mode.  For example, one window may dis-
       play  a  file  with its lines wrapped while another may be
       truncating the lines.  Windows may be `locked' together in
       the  sense  that if one of the locked windows scrolls, all
       locked windows will  scroll.   _m_o_s_t  is  also  capable  of
       ignoring  lines  that are indented beyond a user specified
       value.  This is useful when viewing computer  programs  to
       pick out gross features of the code.  See the `::oo' command
       for a description of this feature.

       In addition to displaying ordinary text  files,  _m_o_s_t  can
       also  display binary files as well as files with arbitrary
       ascii characters.  When a file is read into a buffer, _m_o_s_t
       examines  the  first  32 bytes of the file to determine if
       the file is a binary file and then switches to the  appro-
       priate  mode.   However, this feature may be disabled with
       the --kk option.  See the description of the --bb, --kk, --vv, and
       --tt options for further details.

       Text  files  may  contain  combinations  of underscore and
       backspace characters causing a  printer  to  underline  or
       overstrike.   When  _m_o_s_t  recognizes  this, it inserts the
       appropriate  escape  sequences  to  achieve  the   desired
       effect.   In  addition,  some  files  cause the printer to
       overstrike some characters by  embedding  carriage  return
       characters  in  the  middle  of a line.  When this occurs,
       _m_o_s_t  displays  the  overstruck  character  with  a   bold
       attribute.   This  feature facilitates the reading of UNIX
       man pages or a document produced by _r_u_n_o_f_f.   In  particu-
       lar,  viewing  this  document  with _m_o_s_t should illustrate
       this behavior provided that the underline characters  have
       not  been  stripped.   This  may be turned off with the --vv
       option.

       By default, lines with more characters than  the  terminal
       width  are  not  wrapped  but are instead truncated.  When

       truncation occurs, this is indicated by a `$' in  the  far
       right  column  of the terminal screen.  The RIGHT and LEFT
       arrow keys may be used to view lines which extend past the
       margins of the screen.  The --ww option may be used to over-
       ride this feature.  When a window is wrapped, the  charac-
       ter `\' will appear at the right edge of the window.

       Commands are listed below.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --11     VT100  mode.   This  is meaningful only on VMS sys-
              tems.  This option should be used if  the  terminal
              is  strictly a VT100.  This implies that the termi-
              nal does not have the ability to delete and  insert
              multiple  lines.   VT102s and above have this abil-
              ity.

       --bb     Binary mode.  Use this switch when you want to view
              files  containing 8 bit characters.  _m_o_s_t will dis-
              play the file 16  bytes  per  line  in  hexidecimal
              notation.  A typical line looks like:

                   01000000 40001575 9C23A020 4000168D     ....@..u.#. @...

              When  used  with the --vv option, the same line looks
              like:

                   ^A^@^@^@  @^@^U u 9C #A0    @^@^V8D     ....@..u.#. @...

       --kk     `Kanji' option.   Ordinarily,  _m_o_s_t  will  go  into
              binary mode if the file consists of non-ascii char-
              acters.  Sometimes this feature  is  not  desirable
              since  some terminals have a special interpretation
              for eight bit characters.  The --kk option turns  off
              the automatic sensing.

       --ss     Squeeze.   Replace multiple blank lines with a sin-
              gle blank line.

       --zz     option turns off gunzip-on-the-fly.

       --vv     Display control characters as in `^A'  for  control
              A.   Normally _m_o_s_t does not interpret control char-
              acters.

       --tt     Display tabs as `^I'.  This  option  is  meaningful
              only  when  used with the --vv option.  ++_l_i_n_e_n_o Start
              up at _l_i_n_e_n_o.

              not.

       ++dd     This  switch  should  only  be used if you want the
              option to delete a file  while  viewing  it.   This

              This is system dependent.  On VMS, this causes _m_o_s_t
              to spawn a subprocess.  When  the  user  exits  the
              process,  _m_o_s_t  is  resumed.  On UNIX systems, _m_o_s_t
              simply suspends itself.

       ::nn     Skip to the next  filename  given  in  the  command
              line.   Use  the  arrow  keys  to scroll forward or
              backward through the file list.  `QQ' quits _m_o_s_t and
              any other key selects the given file.

       ::cc     Toggle case sensitive search.

       ::DD     Delete current file.  This command is only meaning-
              ful with the ++dd switch.

       ::oo, ::OO Toggle various options.  With  this  key  sequence,
              _m_o_s_t  displays  a prompt asking the user to hit one
              of: bbddttvvww.  The `bb', `tt', `vv', and `ww' options have
              the same meaning as the command line switches.  For
              example, the `ww' option will toggle wrapping on and
              off for the current window.

              The  `dd'  option must be used with a prefix integer
              _i.  All lines indented beyond _i columns will not be
              displayed.  For example, consider the fragment:

                   int main(int argc, char **argv)
                   {
                        int i;

                        for (i = 0; i < argc, i++)
                        {
                             fprintf(stdout,"%i: %s\n",i,argv[i]);
                        }
                        return 0;
                   }

              The  key sequence `11::oodd' will cause _m_o_s_t to display
              the file ignoring all  lines  indented  beyond  the
              first column.  So for the example above, _m_o_s_t would
              display:

                   int main(int argc, char **argv)...
                   }

              where the `...' indicates lines follow are not dis-

       _m_o_s_t uses the following environment variables:

       MMOOSSTT__SSWWIITTCCHHEESS
              This variable sets  commonly  used  switches.   For
              example, some people prefer to use _m_o_s_t with the --ss
              option so that excess  blank  lines  are  not  dis-
              played.   On  VMS this is normally done done in the

       MMOOSSTT__EEDDIITTOORR, SSLLAANNGG__EEDDIITTOORR
              Either of these environment  variables  specify  an
              editor for _m_o_s_t to invoke to edit a file. The value
              can contain %s and %d formatting  descriptors  that
              represent  the  file  name and line number, respec-
              tively.  For example, if JED is your  editor,  then
              set MMOOSSTT__EEDDIITTOORR to 'jed %s -g %d'.

       MMOOSSTT__HHEELLPP

              personal configuration file called _._m_o_s_t_r_c on Unix,

       sseettkkeeyy ffuunnccttiioonn--nnaammee kkeeyy--sseeqquueennccee

       The _s_e_t_k_e_y command requires two arguments.  The  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-
       _n_a_m_e  argument  specifies  the function that is to be exe-
       cuted as a response to the  keys  specified  by  the  _k_e_y_-
       _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e argument are pressed.  For example,

             setkey   "up"     "^P"

       indicates that when _C_t_r_l_-_P is pressed then the function _u_p
       is to be executed.

       Sometimes, it is necessary to first unbind a  key-sequence
       before rebinding it in order via the _u_n_s_e_t_k_e_y function:

              unsetkey "^F"

       Colors may be defined through the use of the _c_o_l_o_r keyword
       in the the configuration file using the syntax:

       ccoolloorr OOBBJJEECCTT--NNAAMMEE FFOORREEGGRROOUUNNDD--CCOOLLOORR BBAACCKKGGRROOUUNNDD--CCOOLLOORR

       Here, OBJECT-NAME can be any one of the following items:

           status           -- the status line
           underline        -- underlined text
           overstrike       -- overstriked text
           normal           -- anything else

       See the sample configuration files for more information.

BBUUGGSS
       Almost all of the known bugs or limitations  of  _m_o_s_t  are
       due  to  a desire to read and interpret control characters
       in files.  One problem concerns the use of backspace char-
       acters to underscore or overstrike other characters.  _m_o_s_t
       makes an attempt to use terminal escape sequences to simu-
       late  this  behavior.  One side effect is the one does not
       always get what one expects when scrolling right and  left
       through  a file.  When in doubt, use the --vv and --bb options
       of _m_o_s_t.

       I would like to thank the users of _m_o_s_t for valuable  com-
       ments  and  criticisms.   I would especially like to thank
       those individuals who have contributed code to _m_o_s_t_.

       Mats Akerberg, Henk D. Davids, Rex O. Livingston, and Mark
       Pizzolato  contributed  to the early VMS versions of _m_o_s_t_.
       In particular, Mark worked on  it  to  get  it  ready  for
       DECUS.

       Foteos  Macrides  <MACRIDES@SCI.WFEB.EDU> adapted _m_o_s_t for
       use in _c_s_w_i_n_g and _g_o_p_h_e_r_.  A few features of  the  present
       version of _m_o_s_t was inspired from his work.

       I  am grateful to Robert Mills <robert@jna.com.au> for re-
       writing the search routines to use regular expressions.

       Sven Oliver Moll <smol0075@rz.uni-hildesheim.de>  came  up
       with the idea of automatic detection of zipped files.

       I  would also like to thank Shinichi Hama for his valuable
       criticisms of _m_o_s_t_.

       Thanks to David W. Sanderson (dws@cs.wisc.edu) for  adapt-
       ing the documentation to nroff man page source format.
